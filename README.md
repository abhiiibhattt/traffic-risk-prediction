# 🚦 Traffic Risk Prediction System

An end-to-end machine learning system for predicting **high-risk traffic accidents**
using spatio-temporal, weather, and road infrastructure features from the
**US Accidents dataset**.

The system supports large-scale data processing, exploratory analysis,
model training, and real-time or batch inference.

---

## 🔍 Problem Overview

Traffic accident severity is influenced by multiple factors such as:
- Time of day and seasonality
- Weather conditions
- Road infrastructure (junctions, crossings, traffic signals)
- Geographic location

The objective of this project is to:
- Predict whether an accident is **high risk** (severe)
- Estimate a **risk probability** that can be used for analysis or decision support

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** US Accidents Dataset  
**Scale:** ~7.7 million accident records across the United States

### Target Definition
- `high_risk = 1` → Severity ≥ 3  
- `high_risk = 0` → Severity ≤ 2  

---

## 🔗 Dataset Access

This repository does **not** include the raw dataset due to its large size.

You can download the **US Accidents Dataset** from the official source:

🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

After downloading:

1. Extract the CSV file
2. Rename it to: US_accidents.csv

3. Place it in: data/raw/US_accidents.csv

The preprocessing pipeline will automatically handle the dataset in chunks.

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

Models trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Interpretable baseline
- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier**
  - Handles missing values natively
  - Scales efficiently to millions of rows
  - Captures non-linear patterns

The best-performing model is automatically saved as:

results/models/best_model.joblib
